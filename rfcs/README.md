# Request for Comments (RFC)

RFCs provide a structured feedback mechanism for design documents. The designs described in RFCs may be considered speculative or experimental. As such, theyd may or may not be implemented in the exact form described (if they are implemented at all).

RFCs are a tool to help participants think together about a design space. The artifacts produced by the RFC process should support collaborative discussion and review of future concrete implementations.

## Requesting Comments

Create a branch and add your RFC as `rfcs/YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-your-design/README.md` and submit it as a pull request to this repository. Supporting media may be included within the same folder.
